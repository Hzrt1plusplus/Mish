# These features can be added: 

1. colored shell messages
2. environmental varaibles
3. shell language syntax like bash
4. cli interface or stream( not std::cin or std::cout) 

# NOTES:
For now, mish is just a simple shell that takes system commands and executes. it is not a professional tool. but it can be extended to high-level shell. 
You can contribute and extend project. If you have an idea about adding a new feature, please contact me. Thank you so much!
